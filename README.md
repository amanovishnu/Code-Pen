# Code-Pen
* freeCodeCamp (also referred to as “Free Code Camp”) is a nonprofit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications, and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone. Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students progress to project assignments that they must complete either alone or in pairs. Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.
